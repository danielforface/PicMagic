## ü§ñ How It Works

Pixshop harnesses the power of multiple Google Gemini models to achieve its results:

- **Image Generation:** The `imagen-4.0-generate-001` model is used for generating new images from text prompts.
- **Image Editing, Filters & Adjustments:** The multi-modal `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` model is the powerhouse behind all image-based editing tasks. By providing the original image along with a carefully engineered text prompt (which includes user input and contextual instructions), the model returns a fully modified image.
- **Prompt Enhancement:** The `gemini-2.5-flash` model is used for its text-generation capabilities to rewrite and enrich user prompts for the image generation feature.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Image Manipulation:** `react-image-crop`, HTML Canvas API

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run Pixshop locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd pixshop
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *This project uses `esm.sh` for on-the-fly module loading, so no traditional `npm install` is needed for the listed dependencies. Ensure you have a local server to serve the `index.html` file.*

3.  **Set up your Environment Variable:**
    The application requires a Google Gemini API key. It must be available as `process.env.API_KEY`. How you set this will depend on your local development server setup.

4.  **Serve the application:**
    Use a simple local server to serve the `index.html` file. For example, using Python:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Or using a tool like `live-server`.

5.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` to start using the application.
